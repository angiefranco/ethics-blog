          <p> In attempting to answer this question I must ask myself what I value more and in what situation that would make sense. As we saw in the readings and the discussion for this week, the government cannot take a stance that protects an individual’s privacy in exchange for the security of the nation as a whole. Regardless of the bigger message that the government is spying on everyone that Edward Snowden might have revealed to a larger public with his leaks, president Obama (as mentioned in the readings) will never be able to pardon him. It is clear to the government and especially the NSA that what happened was Edward Snowden compromised national security by stealing really classified information. This means that the government will never ever be able to pardon him because the precedent would be bigger than we can imagine: the government validating the importance of individual privacy over national security. That would simply go against the true purpose of the federal government which is truly to ensure that all of the constituents are safe.</p>

          <p> It makes sense that many people idealize, admire, or look up to Edward Snowden for what he shed a light on. However, the ACLU and other civil rights organizations, and even the way Snowden himself handled his own story truly just downplayed the magnitude of what he did: stole national security information and truly put his own country in jeopardy. Nevertheless, if we move beyond what he did (which I believe was just plain wrong and not the way to advocate for his supposed cause), what the leaks revealed apart from national secrets was the level of surveillance that the government conducts on everyone. </p>

          <p>I as a constituent am willing to give up some of my personal information if that means that we are all in the end safer because of it. Nevertheless, as we saw with the readings, things like the NSA’s call records program truly didn’t bring valuable information that resulted in attacks being prevented or potential transgressors or attackers being apprehended. If that is the case, where the government just collects and sits on personal information that serves no good security purpose, then such program should be stopped. Some people were very angered when they realized the true amount of information the government has access to from all of us. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that advertising companies are worse in that they not only continuously track what you do and consume, sometimes without your knowledge, but they also sell that information to the highest bidder. So honestly, if the government wants to use my information (and the information of everyone else) to make sure they can do their best to keep everyone safe, I would take that any day over an advertising company.
