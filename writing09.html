          <p> Intellectual property should be afforded protections under an efficient and equitable system that promotes economic growth and does not stall innovation. This is very difficult to do, as we have seen from the readings on patent trolls that essentially the root cause of stifling lawsuits by patent trolls are the result of vague patents.</p>

          <p>I would not compare intellectual property directly with physical property, but I would try to finetune the current system so that these patent monopolies don’t become hungry lawyers and companies profiting off of code they didn’t work on and/or smaller companies struggling to make ends meet. I believe in today’s world, as we saw from multiple examples in the readings of costly lawsuits, IP laws are currently preventing innovation. I think the root of the problem is that patents for technological innovations were initially too vague, and a good lawyer can spin any court case around to obtain what they need from it if they really want to. Unlike physical property, the use and innovative value of intellectual property has a lot of room for interpretation. </p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>In fact, we must start from the point that the reason we have been able to advance so quickly in the world of technology is because innovators have been given the tools to build upon and create new things. Free software, free languages, the ability to compile code. The infinite libraries of documentation on language syntax and libraries. All the things we have available that we can use to create software all come from inventions that came before us. Even with the system being stifled by patent litigation, we have been able to make progress. I cannot imagine what we would be able to experience if the system allowed for people to build on and improve others’ inventions without the shackles of the current vague and inefficient patent laws.</p>

          <p>Another topic that we discussed surrounded copyright issues. Copyrighted material has always been incredibly important to big business. And it makes sense, they spent a lot of money developing that material. However, I am a firm believer that DRM for copyrighted material that a person PAYS FOR is a little too extreme. We saw from the reading the Celine Dion CD case, where the copyright protection installed in the CD actually installed a rootkit on the hardware of your computer — okay sounds like a black mirror episode and it truly seems like a step too far. Look, if a person paid for the content they should be able to reproduce it in any platform and not be limited to a certain channel to enjoy the content. I understand the obvious concern of illegal reproduction and selling, but what we must focus on then is on being more ethical with our choices. I know I sound incredibly idealistic but actually when I was a kid and went to the movies in Colombia they showed this really moving ad of two kids realizing their dad is a “pirate” because of the bad quality movies they always saw. I know it sounds silly but that did it for me, I never wanted to be the kid - or worse someday - the parent in that scenario. I never downloaded copyrighted content without paying for it again. And I do feel it’s possible to discern good and bad in this case. But this is obviously incredibly far from actually happening timewise. Nevertheless, I hope that examples like the Celine Dion CD (and unfortunately its miserable way to make up for it) resonate more with the technology community and we fight to truly own content we purchase, not merely lease it.</p>

          <p>Right now there are sanitary problems (such as access to clean water(!)) that are still pervasive in many parts of the world, incredibly so. The countries that can afford to look to the future in terms of this advanced technology should keep the rest of the world in their minds, and know that those problems are still very much relevant in many parts of the world. The question that we seem to be unable to answer is what is the best way to solve these problems, and what is the best way to get the solutions to these places?</p>
