          <p>The computing and technology community are lagging behind other STEM disciplines in terms of numbers of women and minorities that make up their population. That’s a fact. I do not want to start my reflection by stating the reasons I believe diversity and inclusion are necessary in a healthy work environment, since I am a minority and consequently would be trying to justify why I believe hiring people like me would bring about a better workplace. Instead, I would like to ask those who are privileged to not have to suffer the stigma of being a minority. Who have never felt out of place anywhere. Who have always been motivated to follow their dreams because “the sky's the limit” and that’s what they’ve been told and that’s what those around them, like-minded and probably from the same privileged group, have been doing as well. I would like to ask them if they believe minorities bring anything they simply cannot to the table. Intangible, valuable insights perhaps? A different perspective? How does that affect the performance of a team? The truth is, the need to push for diversity and inclusion in companies across all industries extends beyond pressure from society to be more inclusive. In 2013, Deloitte published a 32 page study where they explain how diversity and inclusion improves business outcomes. It turns out that diverse teams innovate and come to decisions 60% faster than non-diverse teams. It’s in the business’ best interest to include different thoughts and perspectives in their company. So why is it so hard to lift up those diversity statistics for technology companies?</p>

          <p>The company culture and environment play a huge role on the way minorities feel at the workplace. As a person who has experienced being the only woman in the room, or the only Latina in the room, I have come to realize that if I didn’t feel welcomed by my teammates and if I hadn’t felt my opinions and ideas were validated by them, I would’ve wanted to leave the room immediately. The women and minorities who are trying to form a part of the technology community have to feel welcomed and valued, because they are valuable additions to the team. How can companies pretend to attract more women and minorities when the ones who are already a part of the community are feeling alienated from the company culture, sometimes even due to the very same programs in place that attempt to integrate and give them an opportunity to join the company. </p>

          <p>I personally think that it is in the industry’s best interest to want to increase the number of minorities in the room. It makes sense for their business and it is also the right thing to do. However, I feel the first step to bolster inclusion in the industry is to work to ensure that all minorities already in all the technology companies feel empowered and welcomed, so they become mentors and champions of diversity and inclusion within their institutions. Personally, I would never look to join a company like Uber, known for its alienation of women and the testimonies of women who have worked in the company. For me, women’s experiences are very important in my deliberation process, and it seems to be the same case for other women as well. </p>
