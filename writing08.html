          <p> Like many of the readings suggest, AI seems to be the type of research that goes through waves of a lot of progress and then times when it is almost completely stagnant. To that thought, the ND magazine touched on the “boom and bust” cycles of AI and really questions: what is the big deal with AI if the forms we have seen of it are very very good at performing one action but cannot do much more beyond that (e.g. play jeopardy, AlphaGO, chess, etc.). in other words, it is a form of AI but far away from a general AI.  It is unclear whether we will be able to really know the true limits of AI as we keep pushing those boundaries further and further, trying to make a type of AI that not only mimics but goes beyond human capabilities seems far off, I don’t think the idea should be completely dismissed for now. </p>

          <p>What I do want to believe is that the reason why we as a human race want to develop more powerful forms of artificial intelligence is because we truly believe it can do us good in the future. That it can solve problems we haven’t been able to. I think AI should be embraced with caution. In the Quanta Magazine article of AlphaGo the author really explains what the achievement of a successful AlphaGo solver is important: to be able to win, the creators were able to mimic in the AI a semblance of human intuition. This goes beyond taking the “best” option given many different ones. It steps into making a certain decision that seems to be the most accurate based on the limited data we have.</p>

          <p>However, with this advanced technology we are seeing a focus on the fear that many have that automation will take their jobs. “Robot apocalypse” as it was referenced by the Gizmodo reading, which really goes in depth into the slow but steady effect of automation on the economy and jobs, specifically in the United States. While it is clear that many people are losing their jobs to automation, the reality is that the workforce is going through a second wave of massive change since the industrial revolution, and the workforce of tomorrow has to prepare for the change, while the workforce of today has to aspire to learn and adapt. </p>


          <p>Nevertheless, because I am an optimist, and very much a technology enthusiast, I would say that AI and advanced intelligence technology is something that should be embraced. I think that the focus of AI should be the problems that we as humans are facing that we haven’t been able to solve ourselves. I recognize this requires a reach that we currently don’t have, but we should push for that— going beyond the puzzle solving and translating that into solving the problems we haven’t yet. That is my hope for the future of AI and other advanced technologies. Bill Gates has been very public and relevant in advocating and funding for solving the sanitary problem that many parts of the world still have. </p>

          <p>Right now there are sanitary problems (such as access to clean water(!)) that are still pervasive in many parts of the world, incredibly so. The countries that can afford to look to the future in terms of this advanced technology should keep the rest of the world in their minds, and know that those problems are still very much relevant in many parts of the world. The question that we seem to be unable to answer is what is the best way to solve these problems, and what is the best way to get the solutions to these places?</p>
